For milestone 1, the general functionality was completed and the application is operational. A user can participate in a survey that contains only text answers, and once submitted the information will be sent to the database. An admin will be able to close the survey - and once closed, can view the results of the survey. This project is integrated with CircleCI, where the build and test results can be viewed. Heroku was used to deploy this application. All tasks were kept track of using a kanban board - and daily scrum meetings were held to ensure that progress is being tracked.
